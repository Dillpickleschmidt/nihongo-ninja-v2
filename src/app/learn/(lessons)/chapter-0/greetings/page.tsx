        Now that you're familiar with the basics, let's dive into some common
        Japanese greetings. These phrases will be your first steps into
        conversational Japanese, and they're essential for everyday
        interactions.

      <VocabCards data={data1} />
      <p className="px-16">
        Another common and slightly more formal way to say goodbye, especially
        in phone conversations or when you&apos;re not sure when you&apos;ll
        meet the person again, is:
      </p>
      <VocabCards data={data2} countOffset={4} />
      <p className="px-16">
        These phrases are great for everyday use and help convey a friendly,
        approachable tone. As with any language, the context and your
        relationship with the person you're speaking to will guide which phrase
        is most appropriate.
