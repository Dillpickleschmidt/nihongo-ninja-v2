              Picture this: some of the Hiragana characters decide to team up,
              and work together. It's a bit like a tag team in a friendly game,
              where two players join forces to win the game.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Take &quot;じゃ (jya)&quot; for example. Here, &quot;じ (ji)&quot;
              teams up with a tiny version of &quot;や (ya)&quot; to create a
              sound that's not just &quot;jiya&quot; but a smoother, more
              compact &quot;jya&quot;. You'll see this dynamic duo popping up in
              words like &quot;じゃあね (jaane - see you)&quot;.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You'll most often see three players in this game who are smart
              enough to work together, the small &quot;ゃ&quot;, &quot;ゅ&quot;,
              and &quot;ょ&quot;, but you'll see others join in the fun too. Why
              are they small? Probably because they were willing to reduce their
              egos for a greater cause. Truly, they're like the special agents
              of the Hiragana world, teaming up with others to create these
              smooth, blended sounds.

          These sounds might seem a bit awkward at first, like learning a new
