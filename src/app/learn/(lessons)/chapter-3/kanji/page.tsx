          Kanji are characters that originated in China and were brought to
          Japan over 1,500 years ago. Each Kanji is a logogram, meaning it
          represents a standalone meaning, as opposed to a sound like English
          characters.

            <li>
              <strong>Elementary school: </strong>1,026 kanji (

        <div>
          <p>
            <span className="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> Kanji can be divided
            into four types based on their formation:
          </p>
          <ol className="ml-9 mt-3 list-decimal space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Pictograms: </strong>These kanji look like what they
              represent. Example: Êú® (tree), Êó• (sun), Â±± (mountain)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simple ideograms: </strong>Abstract concepts represented
              by simple symbols. Example: ‰∏ä (up), ‰∏ã (down), ‰∏≠ (middle)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compound ideograms: </strong>Two or more kanji combined to
              create a new meaning. Example: Êûó (forest) is two Êú® (tree)
              characters put together.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phonetic-ideographic characters: </strong>Combines an
              element that expresses meaning and an element that represents a
              sound.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <span className="font-extrabold">Student:</span> How do I{" "}
          <em>read</em> them?

        <div>
          <p>
            <span className="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> Well, since you
            asked, there are <em>technically</em> two ways to read kanji, but
            there's also a third option that's much easier to remember:
          </p>
          <ol className="ml-9 mt-3 list-decimal space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>On-yomi </strong>(
              <span className="font-japanese">Èü≥Ë™≠„Åø</span>): Chinese-derived
              readings
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Kun-yomi </strong>(
              <span className="font-japanese">Ë®ìË™≠„Åø</span>): Native Japanese
              readings
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mt-3">
            For example, the kanji <span className="font-japanese">Â±±</span>{" "}
            (mountain) can be read as:
          </p>
          <ul className="ml-9 mt-3 list-disc space-y-2">
            <li>
              On-yomi: <span className="font-japanese text-xl">„Çµ„É≥</span>{" "}
              (san), <span className="font-japanese text-xl">„Çª„É≥</span> (sen)

            <li>
              Kun-yomi: <span className="font-japanese text-xl">„ÇÑ„Åæ</span>{" "}
              (yama)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 text-base italic text-muted-foreground">
            *There are also <strong>name</strong> readings which are unique
            readings for peoples' names.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            In many cases, a single kanji will have <strong>multiple</strong>{" "}
            on-yomi and kun-yomi readings.

          <p className="mt-3 text-base italic">
            You will see these whenver you look up a kanji in a dictionary.

            Let me get this straight... Not only do I have to remember{" "}
            <strong>thousands</strong> of characters, but I also have to
            remember <strong>multiple readings</strong> for each character? üò®

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-center text-3xl font-bold italic">No!</h3>
          <p className="mt-4">
            In fact, we recommend you{" "}
            <span className="italic underline">
              forget about the on-yomi/kun-yomi readings
            </span>
            . Instead, focus on learning <strong>vocabulary</strong> and the{" "}
            English <strong>meanings</strong> of the kanji you come across,
            exactly as you've been doing on <strong>jpdb</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Think about it like this: </strong>In English, there are at
            least a dozen (maybe more) ways to pronounce the letter{" "}
            <span className="font-black">a</span>:
            <ul className="ml-9 mt-3 list-disc space-y-2">
              <li>A = /√¶/ - Apple, Fantastic, Back, Track, Exactly</li>
              <li> A = /e/ - Any, Many, Said, Says, Thames</li>
              <li>A = /…í/ - What, Watch, Want, Was, Wash, Yacht</li>
              <li>A = /e…™/ - Able, Age, Page, Paper, Day, Date, Stay</li>
              <li>A = /e…ô/ - Air, Share, Care, Spare, Stare, Rare</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4 text-center italic">The list goes on...</p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              But do you memorize each pronunciation of{" "}
              <span className="font-black">a</span> in isolation?{" "}
              <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> You learn the <em>vocabulary</em>{" "}
              and pick up the different pronunciations of{" "}
              <span className="font-black">a</span> as you go along. We believe
              the same goes for kanji readings. Focus on vocabulary and the
              meanings of the kanji you're learning, and you'll naturally pick
              up the readings over time.
