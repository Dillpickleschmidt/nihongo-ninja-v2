        What is Hiragana?
      </h2>
      <div className="sm:px-24 px-16 space-y-9">
        <p>
          Hiragana is one of the three main scripts used in Japanese writing,
          along with Katakana and Kanji, often referred to as the foundational
          writing system in Japanese. It's primarily used for{" "}
          <strong>native</strong> Japanese words and{" "}
          <strong>grammatical elements</strong> that connect words into
          sentences. Each Hiragana character represents a distinct sound, and
          these characters can be combined to form words.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a total of <strong>46</strong> Hiragana characters. It
          sounds like a lot, but don't worry! They all include the same 5 vowels
          that you've already seen.
        </p>

            <li>„ÅÇ a</li>
            <li>„ÅÑ i</li>

            <li>„Åà e</li>
            <li>„Åä o</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Remember this pattern! 'a, i, u, e, o'. If you memorize that, the rest
          will come more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we just add a consonant to each of these. Adding 'k' will give
          us five new characters:

              Excellent observation, young apprentice. Some characters do veer{" "}
              <em>slightly</em> off the pattern, but they're nothing that you
              haven't pronounced before in English.

          <em>
            Learning Hiragana is like building the foundation of a house. It
            takes time and practice, but everything you learn after this will
            rely on this fundamental knowledge. So, take your time, practice
            regularly, and most importantly, enjoy the process, young
            grasshopper.
